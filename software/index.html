<h3>Pandas</h3>
<p>I have made some <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits?author=reidy-p">contributions</a> to the <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/>pandas</a> library for data analysis in Python.</p>

<h3>Strava Stats</h3>
<a href="https://www.strava.com">Strava</a> is a popular social network where runners and cyclists can upload and compare data from their activities. <a href="https://www.github.com/reidy-p/strava-stats/">Strava Stats</a> allows a user to download the data from running activities that they have uploaded to Strava and to calculate and view additional statistics in a web app. It is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/MathBunny/strava-wind-analysis">Strava Wind Analysis</a> app for cyclists.
