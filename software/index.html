<h3>Pandas</h3>
<p>I have made some <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits?author=reidy-p">contributions</a> to the <a href=https://pandas.pydata.org/>pandas</a> library for data analysis in Python.</p>

<h3>Strava Stats</h3>
<a href="https://www.strava.com">Strava</a> is a popular social network where runners and cyclists can upload and compare data from their activities. <a href="https://www.github.com/reidy-p/strava-stats/">Strava Stats</a> allows a user to download the data from running activities that they have uploaded to Strava and to calculate and view additional statistics in a web app. It is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/MathBunny/strava-wind-analysis">Strava Wind Analysis</a> app for cyclists.

<h3>Resurface</h3>
<a href="https://getresurface.net">Resurface</a> gathers all of your favourite content from the web in one place and sends your regular reminders with samples of your favourites so you can rediscover the best of the web. The code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/reidy-p/resurface">GitHub</a>.
